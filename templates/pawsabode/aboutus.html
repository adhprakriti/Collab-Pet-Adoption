      <h1>Welcome to PawsAbode!</h1>
      <p>At PawsAbode, we believe that every dog deserves a loving home. Founded in 2024, we are a passionate team based in Nepal dedicated to connecting homeless dogs with caring families.</p>

      <h2>Our Mission:</h2>
      <p>Our mission is simple yet profound: to rescue, rehabilitate, and rehome dogs in need. We strive to create a world where every dog has a warm bed, a full belly, and a wagging tail.</p>

      <h2>Why Choose PawsAbode?</h2>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Compassionate Approach:</strong> We treat every dog with the love and respect they deserve. Our team is committed to providing them with the care and attention they need to thrive.</li>
          <li><strong>Local Expertise:</strong> With our deep understanding of the local community and its needs, we are well-equipped to find the perfect match between dogs and adopters.</li>
          <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> We believe in transparency every step of the way. From the adoption process to our financials, we are open and honest with our supporters.</li>
          <li><strong>Ongoing Support:</strong> Our commitment doesn't end once a dog finds their forever home. We offer ongoing support and resources to adopters to ensure a smooth transition for both the dog and their new family.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Our Adoption Process:</h2>
      <ol>
          <li><strong>Application:</strong> Prospective adopters fill out an application form to tell us about their lifestyle, preferences, and expectations.</li>
          <li><strong>Meet &amp; Greet:</strong> Once we receive an application, we arrange a meet-and-greet session where the adopter can spend time with the dog and see if it's a good fit.</li>
          <li><strong>Home Visit:</strong> We conduct a home visit to ensure that the environment is suitable for the dog and to address any concerns or questions the adopter may have.</li>
          <li><strong>Finalization:</strong> If everything checks out, we finalize the adoption process and send the dog off to their new forever home with a wagging tail.</li>
      </ol>
